* Docker and Node environment

  We are using [[https://www.docker.com/][Docker]] to have an isolated environment were we can develop the application.
  Navigate to this project in a shell. The first command will download the node base
  container, start it and attach a tty to us. The next command will start the development
  server.

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
